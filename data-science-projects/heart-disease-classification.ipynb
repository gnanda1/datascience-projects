    "## Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will explore some foundational machine learning and data science concepts by exploring the problem of heart disease `classification`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is `classification`?\n",
    "\n",
    "Classification involves deciding whether a sample is part of one class or another(`single-class classification`). If there are multiple class options, it's referred to as `multi-class classification`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "In our case, the problem we will be exploring is `binary classification`.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Binary classification` refers to those classification tasks that have two class labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Email spam detection (spam or not).\n",
    "* Churn prediction (churn or not).\n",
    "* Conversion prediction (buy or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The data has been downloaded in a formatted way from <a href=\"https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasm\n",
    "    eem/heart-disease-classification-dataset\">Kaggale Dataset</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The original database contains 76 attributes, but here only 14 attributes will be used. `Attributes` (also called features) are the variables what we'll use to predict our `target variable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Attributes and features are also referred to as `independent variables` and a target variable can be referred to as a `dependent variable`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the independent variables to predict our dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or in our case, the independent variables are a patients different medical attributes and the dependent variable is whether or not they have heart disease.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Evalution\n",
    "If we can reach 95% accuracy at predicting whether or not a patient has heart disease during the proof of concept, we'll pursure this project. This is a rough estimate/goal for a machine learning engineer/data scientist to to work towards. However, due to the nature of experimentation , the evaluation metric may change overtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Features\n",
    "Creating a data dictionary for our heart disease problem. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are the features we'll use to predict our target variable (heart disease or no heart disease).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. age - age in years\n",
    "2. sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)\n",
    "3. cp - chest pain type\n",
    "    * 0: Typical angina: chest pain related decrease blood supply to the heart\n",
    "    * 1: Atypical angina: chest pain not related to heart\n",
    "    * 2: Non-anginal pain: typically esophageal spasms (non heart related)\n",
    "    * 3: Asymptomatic: chest pain not showing signs of disease\n",
    "4. trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)\n",
    "    * anything above 130-140 is typically cause for concern\n",
    "5. chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl\n",
    "    * serum = LDL + HDL + .2 * triglycerides\n",
    "    * above 200 is cause for concern\n",
    "6. fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)\n",
    "    * '>126' mg/dL signals diabetes\n",
    "7. restecg - resting electrocardiographic results\n",
    "    * 0: Nothing to note\n",
    "    * 1: ST-T Wave abnormality\n",
    "        * can range from mild symptoms to severe problems\n",
    "        * signals non-normal heart beat\n",
    "    * 2: Possible or definite left ventricular hypertrophy\n",
    "        * Enlarged heart's main pumping chamber\n",
    "        * thalach - maximum heart rate achieved\n",
    "8. exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)\n",
    "9. oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest\n",
    "    * looks at stress of heart during excercise\n",
    "    * unhealthy heart will stress more\n",
    "11. slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment\n",
    "    * 0: Upsloping: better heart rate with excercise (uncommon)\n",
    "    * 1: Flatsloping: minimal change (typical healthy heart)\n",
    "    * 2: Downslopins: signs of unhealthy heart\n",
    "12. ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy\n",
    "    * colored vessel means the doctor can see the blood passing through\n",
    "    * the more blood movement the better (no clots)\n",
    "13. thal - thalium stress result\n",
    "    * 1,3: normal\n",
    "    * 6: fixed defect: used to be defect but ok now\n",
    "    * 7: reversable defect: no proper blood movement when excercising\n",
    "14) target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no) (= the predicted attribute)\n",
